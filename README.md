# Dashboard for visualizing conference summaries
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
## Github Page URL: https://loveyourself999.github.io/conference-dashboard/

## Overall Idea
### Build a dashboard application that visualize the youtube summaries to nevigate video content
1. Create an information dashboard using Next.js and Recharts.(https://ably.com/blog/informational-dashboard-with-nextjs-and-recharts#creating-the-charts-component)
2. Use D3 library for data visualization when developing the UI(https://d3js.org)
3. Fetch data from the summaries data collected by Github Action
4. Deploy dashboard app to GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions(https://pages.github.com)

### To build a next.js app:
  create a next.js file using command "create-next-app + your file name"
  echo "hello GitHub" #Bash
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
